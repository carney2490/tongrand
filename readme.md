# Random Pair Generator

The tendency with primary learners is to treat the class as a whole group and underestimate their ability to work in pairs or in small groups. Even very young learners can become independent in their learning and guided early on they will be more likely to grow into autonomous and successful learners.

    The advantages of pair work and small group work
    -   Gives learners more time
    -   Changes the pace of the lesson
    -   Allows each individual to mix with everyone in the group
    -   Gives them a sense of achievement when reaching a team goal
    -   Teaches students how to lead and be led by someone other than the instructor
